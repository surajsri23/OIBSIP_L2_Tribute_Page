                                13 JAMMU AND KASHMIR RIFLES (IC 57556)
                                During 'Operation Vijay', on 20 June 1999, Captain Vikram Batra, Commander Delta Company
                                was tasked to attack Point 5140. Captain Batra with his company skirted around the
                                feature from the East and maintaining surprise reached within assaulting distance of the
                                enemy. Captain Batra reorganized his column and motivated his men to physically assault
                                the enemy positions. Leading from the front, he in a daredevil assault, pounced on the
                                enemy and killed four of them in a hand-to hand fight. On 7 July 1999, in another
                                operation in the area Pt 4875, his company was tasked to clear a narrow feature with
                                sharp cuttings on either side and heavily fortified enemy defences that covered the only
                                approach to it. For speedy operation, Captain Batra assaulted the enemy position along a
                                narrow ridge and engaged the enemy in a fierce hand –to-hand fight and killed five enemy
                                soldiers at point blank range. Despite sustaining grave injuries, he crawled towards the
                                enemy and hurled grenades clearing the position with utter disregard to his personal
                                safety, leading from the front, he rallied his men and pressed on the attack and
                                achieved a near impossible military task in the face of heavy enemy fire. The officer,
                                however, succumbed to his injuries. Inspired by his daredevil act, his troops fell upon
                                the enemy with vengeance, annihilated them and captured Point 4875.

                                Captain Vikram Batra, thus, displayed the most conspicuous personal bravery and
                                leadership of the highest order in the face of the enemy and made the supreme sacrifice
                                in the highest traditions of the Indian Army.

                                Batra was born on 9 September 1974, in a Punjabi Khatri family[1] in a small town in
                                Palampur, Himachal Pradesh. He was the third child of Girdhari Lal Batra, a government
                                school principal, and Kamal Kanta Batra, a school teacher. He was the elder of twin
                                sons, born fourteen minutes before his brother, Vishal. The twins were nicknamed: 'Luv'
                                (Vikram) and 'Kush' (Vishal), after the twin sons of the Hindu deity Rama, by their
                                mother who was a professed devotee of Rama.[2] He had two sisters: Seema and Nutan.[3]
                                As a young child, Batra received his primary education under the tutelage of his
                                mother.[4][5] He then attended the D.A.V. Public School in Palampur, where he studied up
                                to middle standard.[4] He received his senior secondary education at Central School in
                                Palampur
